The proposed system builds upon existing disaster management frameworks while incorporating advanced AI capabilities for enhanced prediction accuracy, automated threat detection, and intelligent resource allocation during crisis situations.

## System Overview and Architecture

The AI-Enabled Disaster Management System represents a comprehensive platform designed to revolutionize disaster preparedness, response, and recovery operations through the integration of satellite data analytics and artificial intelligence technologies. The system architecture follows a distributed microservices approach, enabling scalable deployment and modular functionality expansion[1]. The core system comprises multiple interconnected components including satellite data acquisition modules, AI-powered prediction engines, real-time monitoring dashboards, and emergency response coordination interfaces.

The foundational architecture leverages a Flask-based web application framework that provides the user interface and API endpoints for system interaction[1]. This web layer serves as the primary interface for disaster management personnel, emergency responders, and administrative users. The system supports multiple user roles including local administrators, rescue departments, health services, police, and fire departments, each with specific access privileges and functional capabilities[2]. The modular design ensures that different departments can access relevant information while maintaining appropriate security boundaries and operational workflows.

The system's core functionality revolves around continuous monitoring of predefined geographical regions, with current implementation supporting major urban areas including Bangalore, Delhi, Pune, Mumbai, and Jammu[1]. Each monitored region is defined by specific bounding box coordinates that enable precise satellite data acquisition and analysis. The system maintains real-time connectivity through WebSocket implementation, allowing for immediate data updates and alert distribution across all connected clients and emergency response teams.

### Distributed Processing Architecture

The system employs a distributed processing architecture that separates data acquisition, processing, and presentation layers to ensure optimal performance and scalability. The satellite data processing component operates independently from the web interface, enabling continuous background operations without affecting user experience. This separation allows for multiple concurrent analysis operations while maintaining system responsiveness for critical emergency situations.

The alert system utilizes a SQLite database for persistent storage of incident data, alert histories, and system configurations[1]. This database-driven approach ensures data integrity and provides comprehensive audit trails for post-incident analysis and system improvement. The database schema supports complex queries for statistical analysis, trend identification, and performance metrics generation.
